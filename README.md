# Trajectory-generation-for-quadrotors-with-obstacles
This MATLAB project develops an autonomous trajectory-generation pipeline for a quadrotor UAV operating in a 3D environment with obstacles. The implementation combines RRT* path planning with minimum-snap polynomial trajectory optimization to generate smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories.
